# Veto

> The authorization kernel for AI agents. Intercept, validate, and control every tool call. Veto sits between an AI agent and its tools — the agent never knows the guardrail exists.

You interact with Veto entirely through the SDK. Install it, wrap your tools, define your rules. The SDK auto-detects which mode to use:

- **Local** (default): `Veto.init()` — YAML rules evaluated in-process, zero network calls
- **Cloud** (recommended): `Veto.init({ apiKey: "veto_..." })` — dashboard, analytics, human-in-the-loop approvals, LLM validation
- **Self-hosted**: `Veto.init({ endpoint: "https://..." })` — same features as cloud, on your infrastructure

TypeScript SDK: `npm install veto-sdk` (v1.7.0)
Python SDK: `pip install veto` (v0.7.0)

## Getting Started

- [What is Veto?](https://docs.runveto.com/docs): Overview, three SDK modes, framework compatibility table, quick setup
- [Installation](https://docs.runveto.com/docs/getting-started/installation): Install TypeScript or Python SDK and initialize config
- [Quick Start](https://docs.runveto.com/docs/getting-started/quick-start): End-to-end setup in 60 seconds with framework examples (OpenAI, Anthropic, Vercel AI SDK, MCP, Python)

## SDKs

- [TypeScript SDK](https://docs.runveto.com/docs/sdk/typescript): Full API reference (v1.7.0) — Veto.init, wrap, wrapTool, exportDecisions, VetoCloudClient, error types, provider adapters, all exports
- [Python SDK](https://docs.runveto.com/docs/sdk/python): Full API reference (v0.7.0) — Veto.init, wrap, wrap_tool, export_decisions, VetoCloudClient, error types
- [CLI](https://docs.runveto.com/docs/sdk/cli): Commands — init, compile (NL → YAML rules), learn (observe → generate), test (gap analysis), version

## Integrations

- [LangChain](https://docs.runveto.com/docs/integrations/langchain): Middleware for createAgent, LangGraph ToolNode wrapper, callback handler — TypeScript and Python with partial denial support
- [Vercel AI SDK](https://docs.runveto.com/docs/integrations/vercel-ai): Middleware for generateText and streamText with tool-call-boundary validation — TypeScript only
- [Browser-Use](https://docs.runveto.com/docs/integrations/browser-use): Controller/Tools wrapper for browser automation actions — TypeScript and Python
- [MCP](https://docs.runveto.com/docs/integrations/mcp): Model Context Protocol tool definitions — auto-detected and converted transparently

## Rules & Policies

- [YAML Rule Format](https://docs.runveto.com/docs/rules/yaml-format): Complete rule syntax — id, name, action (block/warn/log/allow/require_approval), tools, conditions, condition_groups (OR logic), description
- [Validation Modes](https://docs.runveto.com/docs/rules/validation-modes): Local, cloud, API, custom (direct LLM), and kernel (Ollama) validation modes with configuration

## Concepts

- [How Validation Works](https://docs.runveto.com/docs/concepts/how-it-works): Three validation paths (client-side deterministic, server-side deterministic, server-side LLM), policy cache, approval flow, session-aware validation, plan limits
- [SDK Modes](https://docs.runveto.com/docs/concepts/modes): Local, cloud, and self-hosted mode detection, init options, operating modes (strict vs log)
- [Constraints Reference](https://docs.runveto.com/docs/concepts/constraints): Every constraint type — number ranges, string validation, array bounds, presence checks, YAML condition operators
- [Budget Constraints](https://docs.runveto.com/docs/concepts/budget-constraints): Per-session cost circuit breaker with fixed and dynamic costs

## Server API

These endpoints are used internally by the SDK when running in cloud or self-hosted mode. You typically don't call them directly.

- [POST /v1/validate](https://docs.runveto.com/docs/api-reference/validate): Core validation endpoint — allow, deny, or require_approval decisions
- [Policies API](https://docs.runveto.com/docs/api-reference/policies): CRUD for tool policies — deterministic constraints, LLM config, session constraints
- [Decisions API](https://docs.runveto.com/docs/api-reference/decisions): List, stats, get by ID, and log client-side decisions
- [Approvals API](https://docs.runveto.com/docs/api-reference/approvals): Human-in-the-loop — list pending, create, poll, resolve (Team plan+)
