title: What is Veto?
description: The permission layer for AI agents. Intercept, validate, and control every tool call.
---

Veto sits between an AI agent and its tools. Every tool call is intercepted, validated against your policies, and either allowed, blocked, or escalated for human approval. The agent never knows the guardrail exists.

```
Agent calls tool ──▶ Veto validates ──▶ Tool executes
                         │
                    ┌────┴────┐
                    │         │
                  allow     deny / require approval
```

## Three validation paths

When using Veto Cloud, tool calls are validated through one of three paths depending on how you configure each tool's policy:

| Path | Where | Latency | Use case |
|------|-------|---------|----------|
| **Client-side deterministic** | SDK | ~1-5ms | Number ranges, string enums, regex, required fields |
| **Server-side deterministic** | Veto Cloud | ~30-50ms | Same constraints + session limits + rate limits |
| **Server-side LLM** | Veto Cloud | ~500-2000ms | Semantic checks, exception lists, natural language policies |

The SDK automatically picks the fastest path. Deterministic policies are cached locally and validated without a network call. LLM policies and policies with session/rate constraints always go through the server.

## Get started in 3 steps

**1. Install the SDK**

```bash
npm install veto-sdk    # TypeScript
pip install veto        # Python
```

**2. Get an API key** from the [Veto dashboard](https://runveto.com) and configure policies for your tools.

**3. Wrap your tools**

```typescript
import { Veto } from 'veto-sdk';

const veto = await Veto.init();
const wrappedTools = veto.wrap(myTools);

// Pass wrapped tools to your agent — the interface is identical
const agent = createAgent({ tools: wrappedTools });
```

Every tool call is now validated against your policies. The agent code doesn't change.

## Features

- **Zero-config fast path** — deterministic constraints run locally in the SDK with no network call
- **Provider agnostic** — OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, LangChain, Vercel AI SDK, browser-use
- **Human-in-the-loop** — escalate sensitive tool calls for human approval before execution
- **LLM validation** — natural language policies for cases static rules can't cover
- **Session-aware** — track per-session call counts, argument history, and cross-tool constraints
- **TypeScript + Python** — identical APIs, identical behavior
- **Real-time dashboard** — monitor every decision at [runveto.com](https://runveto.com)
