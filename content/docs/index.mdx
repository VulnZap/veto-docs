title: What is Veto?
description: The authorization layer for AI agents. Intercept, validate, and control every tool call.
---

Veto sits between an AI agent and its tools. Every tool call is intercepted, validated against your rules, and either allowed, blocked, or escalated for human approval. The agent never knows the guardrail exists.

```text title="How it works"
Agent calls tool ──▶ Veto validates ──▶ Tool executes
                          │
                     ┌────┴────┐
                     │         │
                   allow     deny / require approval
```

## The integration pattern

Install the SDK, wrap your tools, define rules in YAML. The agent code doesn't change.

<Tabs items={["TypeScript", "Python"]}>
<Tab value="TypeScript">
```typescript
import { Veto } from 'veto-sdk';

const veto = await Veto.init();
const tools = veto.wrap(myTools); // drop-in replacement

const agent = createAgent({ tools }); // agent is unaware of Veto
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="Python">
```python
from veto import Veto

veto = await Veto.init()
tools = veto.wrap(my_tools)  # drop-in replacement

agent = create_agent(tools=tools)  # agent is unaware of Veto
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

Rules live in YAML files that the SDK loads automatically:

```yaml title="veto/rules/default.yaml"
rules:
  - id: limit-transfers
    action: block
    tools: [transfer_funds]
    conditions:
      - field: arguments.amount
        operator: greater_than
        value: 10000
```

See the [Quick Start](/docs/getting-started/quick-start) for complete, runnable examples with OpenAI, Anthropic, Vercel AI SDK, LangChain, Python, and MCP.

## Features

- **Local-first** — works out of the box with YAML rules, no API key or account needed
- **One-line integration** — `veto.wrap(tools)` works with any provider, any framework
- **Human-in-the-loop** — escalate sensitive tool calls for human approval before execution
- **LLM validation** — natural language policies for cases static rules can't cover
- **Budget constraints** — per-session cost circuit breaker for tool calls
- **Session-aware** — track per-session call counts, argument history, and cross-tool constraints
- **CLI tooling** — `veto compile` (NL → rules), `veto learn` (observe → generate), `veto test` (gap analysis)
- **TypeScript + Python** — identical APIs, identical behavior
- **Real-time dashboard** — monitor every decision at [runveto.com](https://runveto.com)

## SDK modes

The SDK auto-detects which mode to use based on how you call `init()`:

| Mode | How to activate | Best for |
|------|----------------|----------|
| **Local** (default) | `Veto.init()` | Development, CI, air-gapped environments. YAML rules evaluated in-process, zero network calls. |
| **Cloud** (recommended) | `Veto.init({ apiKey: "veto_..." })` | Production. Dashboard, analytics, human-in-the-loop approvals, LLM validation. |
| **Self-hosted** | `Veto.init({ endpoint: "https://..." })` | Enterprises with data residency requirements. Same features as cloud, on your infrastructure. |

Start local, upgrade to cloud when you need visibility. The SDK manages policy caching, approval polling, and decision logging. See [SDK Modes](/docs/concepts/modes).

## Framework support

The SDK wraps any tool format. Deep integrations for [OpenAI SDK](/docs/integrations/openai-sdk), [OpenAI Agents](/docs/integrations/openai-agents), [Anthropic](/docs/integrations/anthropic-sdk), [Google Gemini](/docs/integrations/google-gemini), [Vercel AI SDK](/docs/integrations/vercel-ai), [LangChain](/docs/integrations/langchain), [LangGraph](/docs/integrations/langgraph), [MCP](/docs/integrations/mcp), [Browser-Use](/docs/integrations/browser-use), [Playwright](/docs/integrations/playwright), [CrewAI](/docs/integrations/crewai), and [PydanticAI](/docs/integrations/pydanticai).
