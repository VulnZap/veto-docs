title: What is Veto?
description: The permission layer for AI agents. Intercept, validate, and control every tool call.
---

Veto is a guardrail system for AI agent tool calls. It sits between an AI agent and its tools — intercepting every tool call, validating it against rules and policies, and allowing, blocking, or escalating for human approval.

The agent is unaware of the guardrail. The tool interface is preserved.

## How it works

1. AI agent calls a tool (e.g. `send_email({to: "...", body: "..."})`)
2. Veto intercepts the call via the SDK
3. Arguments are validated against your rules (YAML constraints + LLM semantic checks)
4. The call is allowed, blocked, or escalated based on the result
5. If allowed, the tool executes normally. If blocked, the agent receives an error

```
┌──────────┐     ┌───────┐     ┌──────────┐
│ AI Agent │────▶│ Veto  │────▶│  Tools   │
│          │     │       │     │          │
│  calls   │     │ rules │     │ execute  │
│  tools   │     │ + LLM │     │ actions  │
└──────────┘     └───────┘     └──────────┘
```

## Features

- **Provider agnostic** — works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, LangChain, Vercel AI SDK
- **YAML rules** — define constraints with simple, declarative YAML
- **LLM validation** — semantic checks for cases static rules can't cover
- **Multiple validation modes** — API (remote server), custom (direct LLM), or kernel (local Ollama)
- **TypeScript + Python SDKs** — first-class support for both languages
- **Dashboard** — real-time monitoring at [runveto.com](https://runveto.com)

## Quick example

```typescript
import { Veto } from 'veto-sdk';

const veto = await Veto.init();
const wrappedTools = veto.wrap(myTools);

// Pass wrapped tools to your agent — it works exactly the same,
// but every call is now validated against your rules
const agent = createAgent({ tools: wrappedTools });
```
