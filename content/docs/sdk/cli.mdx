## Installation

The CLI is included with both SDKs:

```bash
# TypeScript (via npx)
npx veto <command>

# Python (installed globally with pip)
veto <command>
```

## Commands

### `veto init`

Scaffolds a new Veto configuration in the current directory.

```bash
npx veto init
```

Creates:

```
veto/
├── veto.config.yaml    # Main configuration file
└── rules/
    └── default.yaml    # Default rule template
```

The generated `veto.config.yaml` defaults to cloud mode:

```yaml
version: "1.0"
mode: "strict"

validation:
  mode: "cloud"

cloud:
  apiKey: "veto_your_key_here"
```

If the `veto/` directory already exists, the command does not overwrite existing files.

### `veto version`

Prints the current SDK version.

```bash
npx veto version
# veto-sdk@1.4.0
```
