title: Policy Drafts API
description: Create, review, and approve policy drafts before they become active policies.
---

Policy drafts let AI agents propose policies that humans can review before activation.

All endpoints require authentication via API key (`X-Veto-API-Key`) or Bearer JWT with `X-Organization-Id` header.

## Draft status lifecycle

`draft` -> `pending_review` -> `approved` or `rejected`

## POST /v1/policy-drafts

Create a policy draft.

### Body

```json
{
  "name": "Guard file operations",
  "description": "Block sensitive path access",
  "projectId": "PROJECT_UUID",
  "createdByAgentId": "agent_123",
  "rules": [
    {
      "id": "block-sensitive-paths",
      "action": "block",

## GET /v1/policy-drafts

### Query params

| Param | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `projectId` | `string (UUID)` | No | Filter by project |
| `status` | `"draft" \| "pending_review" \| "approved" \| "rejected"` | No | Filter by status |

### Example

```

## GET /v1/policy-drafts/:id

Get one draft by ID.

## PATCH /v1/policy-drafts/:id

Update `name`, `description`, `rules`, or `status`.

## DELETE /v1/policy-drafts/:id

Delete a draft.

Returns `204 No Content` on success.

## POST /v1/policy-drafts/:id/submit

Move a draft from `draft` to `pending_review`.

If the draft is not in `draft` status, returns a validation error.

## POST /v1/policy-drafts/:id/approve

Approve a `pending_review` draft and apply policies.

Approval behavior:
- Requires authenticated user context (not API-key-only auth).
- Only rules with `action: "allow"` or `action: "block"` are approvable.
- Disabled rules (`enabled: false`) are skipped.
- Rules must target at least one tool and include at least one condition.
- Multiple rules for the same tool are merged into a single active policy constraint set.

## POST /v1/policy-drafts/:id/reject

Reject a `pending_review` draft.

Sets:
- `status: "rejected"`
- `reviewedBy`
- `reviewedAt`

## Frontend integration

The dashboard consumes this API at `/dashboard/drafts` and defaults to listing `pending_review` drafts.
