title: SDK Modes
description: Three runtime modes — local, cloud, and self-hosted — with automatic detection at init.
---

The SDK auto-detects which mode to use based on what you pass to `Veto.init()`. No explicit mode configuration is needed.

## Mode detection precedence

The SDK checks these in order and uses the first match:

| Priority | Condition | Mode |
|----------|-----------|------|
| 1 | `options.endpoint` is set | **Self-hosted** |
| 2 | `options.apiKey` is set | **Cloud** |
| 3 | `config.validation.mode` is set explicitly | Uses that mode |
| 4 | `VETO_API_KEY` env var is set | **Cloud** |
| 5 | `config.cloud.baseUrl` is a non-default URL | **Self-hosted** |
| 6 | Nothing | **Local** (default) |

On startup, the SDK logs which mode was selected:

```
[VETO] INFO  Veto running in local mode
```

## Local mode (default)

Zero network calls. Rules are loaded from `./veto/rules/*.yaml` and evaluated in-process.

```typescript
const veto = await Veto.init();
```

**What it does:**
- Reads YAML rules from `./veto/rules/`
- Evaluates all condition operators locally (expression-based and legacy field/operator)
- Logs decisions to stdout
- No API key, no account, no network traffic

**Best for:** Development, CI pipelines, air-gapped environments, getting started.

## Cloud mode

Activated by providing an API key. Policies are managed in the [Veto dashboard](https://runveto.com) and cached locally with stale-while-revalidate.

```typescript
// Via options
const veto = await Veto.init({ apiKey: "veto_..." });

// Via environment variable
// export VETO_API_KEY=veto_...
const veto = await Veto.init();

// Via config file
// cloud:
//   apiKey: "veto_..."
const veto = await Veto.init();
```

**What it does:**
- Fetches policies from the cloud and caches them locally
- Deterministic policies run client-side (~1-5ms)
- LLM policies route through the server (~500-2000ms)
- Approval workflows pause until a human resolves
- Decisions logged to the dashboard for audit

**Best for:** Production teams needing visibility, approval workflows, and analytics.

## Self-hosted mode

Activated by providing an endpoint URL pointing to your own Veto server.

```typescript
// Your own Veto server
const veto = await Veto.init({
  endpoint: "https://veto.internal.corp.com",
});

// Self-hosted with API key authentication
const veto = await Veto.init({
  endpoint: "https://veto.internal.corp.com",
  apiKey: "veto_...",
});
```

The server is available as a container image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/vulnzap/veto-server:latest
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e DATABASE_URL=postgres://... ghcr.io/vulnzap/veto-server:latest
```

**What it does:**
- Runs the validation server (deterministic + LLM policies) on your infrastructure
- The `apiKey` authenticates against your self-hosted server
- All data stays within your network
- Decision logging to your own PostgreSQL database

**Not included:** The self-hosted server is the validation API only. The dashboard, analytics UI, and approval management UI are available through [Veto Cloud](https://runveto.com). You can query decisions and manage approvals programmatically via the [Server API](/docs/api-reference/decisions).

**Best for:** Enterprises with data residency requirements who need server-side validation on their own infrastructure.

If both `endpoint` and `apiKey` are provided, the SDK logs a warning and uses self-hosted mode with the API key for authentication.

## Init options reference

```typescript
interface VetoOptions {
  configDir?: string;     // default: "./veto"
  mode?: "strict" | "log";
  apiKey?: string;        // triggers cloud mode
  endpoint?: string;      // triggers self-hosted mode
  logLevel?: string;
  sessionId?: string;
  agentId?: string;
  validators?: Validator[];
  cloudClient?: VetoCloudClient;
  onApprovalRequired?: (context: ValidationContext, approvalId: string) => void;
}
```

## Config file examples

### Local (default)

No `validation.mode` needed — this is the default:

```yaml
version: "1.0"
mode: "strict"
```

### Cloud

```yaml
version: "1.0"
mode: "strict"

validation:
  mode: "cloud"

cloud:
  apiKey: "veto_..."
```

### Self-hosted

```yaml
version: "1.0"
mode: "strict"

validation:
  mode: "cloud"

cloud:
  baseUrl: "https://veto.internal.corp.com"
```

## Operating modes

Orthogonal to the runtime mode, Veto has two operating modes that control what happens when a tool call is denied:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `strict` | Blocks denied calls — throws `ToolCallDeniedError` |
| `log` | Logs denied calls but allows execution to continue |

Use `log` mode during initial rollout to observe what would be blocked without affecting agent behavior.
