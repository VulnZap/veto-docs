title: How Validation Works
description: Architecture of Veto's three validation paths — client-side deterministic, server-side deterministic, and server-side LLM.
---

When you wrap tools with the Veto SDK, every tool call goes through a validation pipeline before execution. The pipeline picks the fastest validation path that can handle your policy.

## The validation pipeline

```

         ▼

  │ cached locally?  │            (server-side validation)
  └────────┬────────┘

    allow     deny
      │         │
      ▼         ▼
  Tool runs   ToolCallDeniedError
      │         │
      └────┬────┘
           ▼
  POST /v1/decisions (async, fire-and-forget)
```

## Path 1: Client-side deterministic

The fastest path. The SDK evaluates constraints locally using a cached copy of the policy.

**When it triggers:**
- The tool's policy is cached (fetched on first call, background-refreshed every 60s)
- The policy mode is `deterministic`
- The policy has no session constraints or rate limits

**What it checks:**
- Number ranges (`minimum`, `maximum`, `greaterThan`, `lessThan`)
- String validation (`enum`, `regex`, `minLength`, `maxLength`)
- Array bounds (`minItems`, `maxItems`)
- Required/null checks (`required`, `notNull`)

**Latency:** ~1-5ms (no network call)

**Decision logging:** The decision is sent to `POST /v1/decisions` asynchronously so the dashboard stays accurate. This never blocks tool execution.

See [Constraints Reference](/docs/concepts/constraints) for every supported constraint type.

## Path 2: Server-side deterministic

The server evaluates the same constraint types as client-side, but also handles stateful checks that require server coordination.

**When it triggers:**
- Cache miss (first call for a tool, or policy expired)
- Policy has session constraints (per-session call limits, argument tracking)
- Policy has rate limits

**What it checks:** Everything client-side checks, plus:
- Session constraints (e.g. "max 3 calls to `delete_record` per session")
- Rate limits (e.g. "max 10 calls per minute")
- Cross-tool constraints (e.g. "if `read_file` was called, block `send_email`")

**Latency:** ~30-50ms (one network round-trip)

## Path 3: Server-side LLM

An LLM evaluates the tool call against natural language policies and exception lists. Use this for checks that can't be expressed as static constraints.

**When it triggers:**
- Policy mode is `llm`

**What it checks:**
- Semantic evaluation against the policy description
- Exception lists (e.g. "deny transfers to external accounts, except for verified vendors")
- Complex multi-argument relationships
- Context-dependent decisions

**Latency:** ~500-2000ms (network + LLM inference)

**Supported models:** Claude (Anthropic), GPT-4o-mini (OpenAI). Configured per-policy in the dashboard.

## Policy cache

The SDK caches policies locally using a stale-while-revalidate strategy:

| Window | Duration | Behavior |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Fresh** | 0 – 60s | Serve from cache immediately |
| **Stale** | 60s – 5min | Serve from cache, refresh in background |
| **Expired** | > 5min | Cache miss, fall through to server |

When a policy is stale, the SDK returns the cached version instantly while fetching the latest version in the background. This means validation latency is consistently low even when policies change — the next call after the background refresh completes will use the updated policy.

Policy changes made in the dashboard take effect within 60 seconds on all connected SDKs.

## Decision flow for approvals

When a policy is configured for human-in-the-loop review, the server returns `require_approval` instead of `allow` or `deny`:

```
POST /v1/tools/validate
         │
         ▼
  decision: "require_approval"
  approval_id: "apr_..."
         │
         ▼
  SDK fires onApprovalRequired hook
  (your app shows approval UI)
         │
         ▼
  SDK polls GET /v1/approvals/:id
  every 2 seconds (configurable)
         │
    ┌────┴─────────┐
    │              │
  approved       denied / expired / timeout
    │              │
  Tool runs     ToolCallDeniedError / ApprovalTimeoutError
```

Configure the approval hook when initializing the SDK:

```typescript
const veto = await Veto.init({
  onApprovalRequired: (context, approvalId) => {
    // Show approval UI, send notification, etc.
  },
});
```

## Session-aware validation

Veto can track per-session state — call counts, cumulative argument values — and enforce constraints that span multiple tool calls within a session.

### Enabling sessions

Pass a `sessionId` when initializing the SDK or in the validation context:

```typescript
const veto = await Veto.init({
  sessionId: "session_abc123",
});
```

Session constraints are always evaluated server-side since they require centralized state tracking.

### Constraint types

| Constraint | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `maxCalls` | Maximum calls to a tool per session | `maxCalls: 5` — block after 5 calls to `delete_record` |
| `cumulativeLimits` | Running sum of a numeric argument | `argumentName: "amount", maxValue: 10000` — block when total transfer amount exceeds 10K |

### Session state

The server tracks state per session:

```json
{
  "callCounts": {
    "transfer_funds": 3,
    "delete_record": 1
  },
  "cumulativeValues": {
    "transfer_funds": {
      "amount": 4500
    }
  }
}
```

`callCounts` increments on every validated call. `cumulativeValues` accumulates non-negative, finite numeric argument values. Non-numeric or negative values are ignored for cumulative tracking.

### How constraints are checked

- **maxCalls**: Checked before the current call is recorded. Fails if `callCounts[toolName] >= maxCalls`.
- **cumulativeLimits**: Checked against `currentSum + incomingValue > maxValue`. Returns the first failing constraint.

Configure session constraints via the [Policies API](/docs/api-reference/policies) using the `sessionConstraints` field.

## Offline validation modes

Besides Veto Cloud, the SDK supports three offline modes that don't require the Veto server:

| Mode | How it works | Config key |
|------|-------------|------------|
| **Custom** | Calls an LLM provider directly (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini) | `validation.mode: "custom"` |
| **Kernel** | Uses a local Ollama model | `validation.mode: "kernel"` |
| **API** | Sends to a self-hosted validation endpoint | `validation.mode: "api"` |

See [Validation Modes](/docs/rules/validation-modes) for configuration details.
