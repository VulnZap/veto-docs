title: Policy Draft Review Workflow
description: Use the dashboard review queue to approve or reject AI-generated policy drafts.
---

This guide covers the human review flow for policy drafts in the dashboard.

## When to use drafts

Use policy drafts when an agent proposes policy changes that should not go live automatically.

Typical use cases:
- Security-sensitive tools (`exec`, file deletion, outbound requests)
- Multi-team workflows where security or platform owners approve changes
- AI-assisted policy generation that needs human verification

## Dashboard review queue

Open:

```text
/dashboard/drafts
```

The page shows drafts in `pending_review` state and allows:
- inspect generated rules and conditions
- approve draft
- reject draft

On approval, Veto creates or updates active policies for each targeted tool.

## Recommended workflow

1. Agent creates draft via `POST /v1/policy-drafts`.
2. Agent or system submits draft via `POST /v1/policy-drafts/:id/submit`.
3. Reviewer opens `/dashboard/drafts`.
4. Reviewer approves or rejects.
5. If approved, monitor policy decisions in `/v1/decisions` and dashboard events.

## Project-scoped review

Drafts can be scoped to a project using `projectId`.

This lets you:
- test stricter policies in one project first
- run customer-specific guardrails without affecting org-wide defaults

The dashboard and API both support project filtering for draft listings.

## Safety checks during approval

During approval, the server enforces:
- rules must include at least one tool
- rules must include at least one condition
- only `allow` / `block` actions are converted to active deterministic constraints
- duplicate constraints are deduplicated when merging multiple rules per tool

If a draft fails validation, approval is rejected and the draft stays pending.
