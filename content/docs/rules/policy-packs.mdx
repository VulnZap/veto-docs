title: Policy Packs
description: Built-in policy packs you can extend and customize with YAML.
---

Veto ships with four built-in policy packs. Add an `extends` field in your YAML file to inherit one, then override or append rules.

```yaml
version: "1.0"
extends: "@veto/coding-agent"

rules:
  # Override an inherited rule by reusing its id.
  - id: coding-agent-block-dangerous-shell-commands
    name: Override shell command block
    action: block
    tools: [run_shell]
    conditions:
      - field: arguments.command
        operator: contains
        value: shutdown

  # Add a new rule alongside inherited rules.
  - id: custom-prod-path-guard
    name: Block writes to prod path
    action: block
    tools: [write_file]
    conditions:
      - field: arguments.path
        operator: starts_with
        value: /prod
```

## Merge behavior

When `extends` is set:

1. Veto loads the parent pack first.
2. Veto merges your `rules` and `output_rules` on top.
3. If your rule ID matches a pack rule ID, your rule fully replaces the pack rule.
4. New rule IDs are appended after pack rules.

If the pack name is invalid (for example `@veto/does-not-exist`), Veto logs an error and skips that policy file.
